<!--Steps-->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<h4>Note 1 - Onions and Garlic</h4>
I use pre prepared frozen, chopped here. An onion weighs about 150g, so replace with that pre chopped weight. Garlic is about 5g per clove so I use 15g (3 teaspoons).

<h4>Note 2 - Sweet Smoked Paprika</h4>
Be sure to use SWEET Smoked, not HOT. The outcome will be very different if you mix them up!

<h4>Note 3 - Gammon Joint</h4>
Slightly bigger is fine if you can't get the exact size. Smoked or unsmoked to your taste is also fine.

<h4>Note 4 - Green Peppers</h4>
I hate overcooked bell peppers, but you have 3 options here for adding the peppers:

<ol>
	<li>Add them with all of the other ingredients before cooking, if you don't mind them very soft, no probs!</li>
	<li>Add them to the slow cooker about an hour before the stew is due to be cooked, they will be just nicely soft - BUT this isn't always possible if you're not at home right?</li>
	<li>Here's what I do: When the stew is ready, I pop the chopped peppers into a covered bowl and microwave them for 4 minutes before adding to the stew before serving (you could also quickly fry them if you don't have a microwave).</li>
</ol>
