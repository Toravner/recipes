<h2><em>The name of the recipe we are preparing today, ova spongia ex lacte, means spongy eggs made with milk. 
    It is really simple to make, but it is important keeping the ratio (this is one of the few cases in which Apicius 
    is specific about the quantities) and choosing an excellent honey, the most important ingredient for a good outcome of the recipe. 
    Ancient Romans, Columella writes, loved in particular savory, thyme, oregano, and rosemary honey.</em></h2>
